# In modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp, the length of buffer AutoBuffer _src
# is small than expected, which will cause copy buffer overflow later. If the
# image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service.
# This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier. Fixed in cve-2017-12601.patch
